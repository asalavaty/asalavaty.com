  abstract  = "Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is one of the most prevalent and
               acute blood cancers with a poor prognosis and low overall
               survival rate, especially in the elderly. Although several new
               AML markers and drug targets have been recently identified, the
               rate of long-term cancer eradication has not improved
               significantly due to the presence and drug resistance of AML
               cancer stem cells (CSCs). Here we develop a novel computational
               pipeline to analyze the transcriptomic profiles of AML cancer
               (stem) cells and identify novel candidate AML CSC markers and
               drug targets. In our novel pipeline we apply a top-down
               meta-analysis strategy to integrate The Cancer Genome Atlas data
               with CSC datasets to infer cell stemness features. As a result,
               a set of genes termed the ``AML key CSC genes'' along with all
               the available drugs/compounds that could target them were
               identified. Overall, our novel computational pipeline could
               retrieve known cancer drugs (Carfilzomib) and predicted novel
               drugs such as Zonisamide, Amitriptyline, and their targets
               amongst the top ranked drugs and drug targets for targeting AML.
               Additionally, the pipeline applied in this study could be used
               for the identification of CSC-specific markers, drivers and
               their respective targeting drugs in other cancer types.",
