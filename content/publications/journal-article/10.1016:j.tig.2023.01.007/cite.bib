  abstract = "Clonal selection and drift drive both normal tissue and cancer
              development. However, the biological mechanisms and environmental
              conditions underpinning these processes remain to be elucidated.
              Clonal selection models are centered in Darwinian evolutionary
              theory, where some clones with the fittest features are selected
              and populate the tissue or tumor. We suggest that different
              subclasses of stem cells, each of which is responsible for a
              distinct feature of the selection process, share common features
              between normal and cancer conditions. While active stem cells
              populate the tissue, dormant cells account for tissue
              replenishment/regeneration in both normal and cancerous tissues.
              We also discuss potential mechanisms that drive clonal drift,
              their interactions with clonal selection, and their similarities
              during normal and cancer tissue development.",
