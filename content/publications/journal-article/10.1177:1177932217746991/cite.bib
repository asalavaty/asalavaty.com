  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: Circadian rhythms are physiological and behavioral
               cycles with a period of approximately 24 hours that control
               various functions including gene expression. Circadian
               disruption is associated with a variety of diseases, especially
               cancer. Although some of the oncogenes and tumor suppressor
               genes (TSGs) are known as clock-controlled genes (CCGs), the
               analysis and annotation of circadian expression of most human
               oncogenes and TSGs are still lacking. This study aims to
               investigate the circadian expression of a list of human
               oncogenes and TSGs. METHODS: A bioinformatic analysis was
               conducted on a gene library comprising 120 genes to investigate
               the circadian expression of human oncogenes and TSGs. To achieve
               this purpose, the genotranscriptomic data were retrieved from
               COSMIC and analyzed by R statistical software. Furthermore, the
               acquired data were analyzed at the transcriptomic and proteomic
               levels using several publicly available databases. Also, the
               significance of all analyses was confirmed statistically.
               RESULTS: Altogether, our results indicated that 7 human
               oncogenes/TSGs may be expressed and function in a circadian
               manner. These oncogenes/TSGs showed a circadian expression
               pattern at CircaDB database and associated with at least one of
               the circadian genes/CCGs based on both genotranscriptomic and
               correlation analyses. CONCLUSIONS: Although 4 of 7 finally
               outputted genes have been previously reported to be clock
               controlled, heretofore there is no report about the circadian
               expression of 3 other genes. Considering the importance of
               oncogenes/TSGs in the initiation and progression of cancer,
               further studies are suggested for the identification of exact
               circadian expression patterns of these 3 human oncogenes/TSGs.",
