  abstract  = "Circadian rhythms refer to the endogenous rhythms that are
               generated to synchronize physiology and behavior with 24-h
               environmental cues. These rhythms are regulated by both external
               cues and molecular clock mechanisms in almost all cells.
               Disruption of circadian rhythms, which is called circadian
               disruption, affects many biological processes within the body
               and results in different long-term diseases, including cancer.
               Circadian regulatory pathways result in rhythmic epigenetic
               modifications and the formation of circadian epigenomes.
               Aberrant epigenetic modifications, such as hypermethylation, due
               to circadian disruption may be involved in the transformation of
               normal cells into cancer cells. Several studies have indicated
               an epigenetic basis for the carcinogenic effects of circadian
               disruption. In this review, I first discuss some of the
               circadian genes and regulatory proteins. Then, I summarize the
               current evidence related to the epigenetic modifications that
               result in circadian disruption. In addition, I explain the
               carcinogenic effects of circadian disruption and highlight its
               potential role in different human cancers using an epigenetic
               viewpoint. Finally, the importance of chronotherapy in cancer
               treatment is highlighted.",
