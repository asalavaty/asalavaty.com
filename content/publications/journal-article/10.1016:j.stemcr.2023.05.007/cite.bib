  abstract = "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)
              primarily infects the respiratory tract, but pulmonary and
              cardiac complications occur in severe coronavirus disease 2019
              (COVID-19). To elucidate molecular mechanisms in the lung and
              heart, we conducted paired experiments in human stem cell-derived
              lung alveolar type II (AT2) epithelial cell and cardiac cultures
              infected with SARS-CoV-2. With CRISPR-Cas9-mediated knockout of
              ACE2, we demonstrated that angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)
              was essential for SARS-CoV-2 infection of both cell types but
              that further processing in lung cells required TMPRSS2, while
              cardiac cells required the endosomal pathway. Host responses were
              significantly different; transcriptome profiling and
              phosphoproteomics responses depended strongly on the cell type.
              We identified several antiviral compounds with distinct antiviral
              and toxicity profiles in lung AT2 and cardiac cells, highlighting
              the importance of using several relevant cell types for
              evaluation of antiviral drugs. Our data provide new insights into
              rational drug combinations for effective treatment of a virus
              that affects multiple organ systems.",
