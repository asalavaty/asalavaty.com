  abstract = "Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) refer to a group of RNAs that are
              usually more than 200 nucleotides and are not involved in protein
              generation. Instead, lncRNAs are involved in different regulatory
              processes, such as regulation of gene expression. Different
              lncRNAs exist throughout the genome. LncRNAs are also known for
              their roles in different human diseases such as cancer. HOTAIR is
              an lncRNA that plays a role as an oncogenic molecule in different
              cancer cells, such as breast, gastric, colorectal, and cervical
              cancer cells. Therefore, HOTAIR expression level is a potential
              biomarker for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes in several
              cancers. This RNA takes part in epigenetic regulation of genes
              and plays an important role in different cellular pathways by
              interacting with Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2). In this
              review, we describe the molecular function and regulation of
              HOTAIR and its role in different types of cancers.",
