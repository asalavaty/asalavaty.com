  abstract = "Sarcopenia, the age-related decline in muscle function, places a
              considerable burden on health-care systems. While the stereotypic
              hallmarks of sarcopenia are well characterized, their
              contribution to muscle wasting remains elusive, which is partly
              due to the limited availability of animal models. Here, we have
              performed cellular and molecular characterization of skeletal
              muscle from the African killifish-an extremely short-lived
              vertebrate-revealing that while many characteristics deteriorate
              with increasing age, supporting the use of killifish as a model
              for sarcopenia research, some features surprisingly reverse to an
              ``early-life'' state in the extremely old stages. This suggests
              that in extremely old animals, there may be mechanisms that
              prevent further deterioration of skeletal muscle, contributing to
              an extension of life span. In line with this, we report a
              reduction in mortality rates in extremely old killifish. To
              identify mechanisms for this phenomenon, we used a systems
              metabolomics approach, which revealed that during aging there is
              a striking depletion of triglycerides, mimicking a state of
              calorie restriction. This results in the activation of
              mitohormesis, increasing Sirt1 levels, which improves lipid
              metabolism and maintains nutrient homeostasis in extremely old
              animals. Pharmacological induction of Sirt1 in aged animals was
              sufficient to induce a late life-like metabolic profile,
              supporting its role in life span extension in vertebrate
              populations that are naturally long-lived. Collectively, our
              results demonstrate that killifish are not only a novel model to
              study the biological processes that govern sarcopenia, but they
              also provide a unique vertebrate system to dissect the regulation
              of longevity.",
