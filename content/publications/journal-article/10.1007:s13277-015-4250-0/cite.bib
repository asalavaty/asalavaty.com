               Their abnormalities can be involved in the initiation and the
               progression of different types of cancer. Nucleosome remodeling
               and deacetylase (NuRD) is an epigenetic complex that comprises
               several subunits such as PHF6. Although PHF6 is reported as a
               tumor suppressor in some of the hematopoietic malignancies, its
               function is still challenging in other cancers. Our study aimed
               at investigating the role of PHF6 in different types of cancer.
               We conducted a meta-analysis of PHF6 in human cancers at
               genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic levels. For this purpose,
               we acquired the data from several databases, and tried to
               statistically integrate and analyze the data in order to find
               the potential role of PHF6 in different tumors. The results
               demonstrated that although PHF6 has been previously known as a
               tumor suppressor gene, it was remarkably overexpressed in many
               cancer types such as breast and colorectal cancers. Notably,
               PHF6 was under-expressed in a few types of cancer, including
               esophageal tumors. Moreover, the results indicated that although
               the mutation rate of PHF6 is relatively low, it is mutated in
               some tumor types. In addition, our data for 40 epigenetic genes
               showed that missense and nonsense mutations were associated with
               overexpression and under-expression, respectively. Our results
               suggest that PHF6 may function as an oncogenic factor in several
               types of cancer. We also hypothesize that PHF6 may also play its
               role in a tissue-specific manner. Our findings suggest further
               investigations regarding the exact role of PHF6 in tumor types.",
