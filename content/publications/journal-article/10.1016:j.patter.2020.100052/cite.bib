  abstract  = "Biological systems are composed of highly complex networks, and
               decoding the functional significance of individual network
               components is critical for understanding healthy and diseased
               states. Several algorithms have been designed to identify the
               most influential regulatory points within a network. However,
               current methods do not address all the topological dimensions of
               a network or correct for inherent positional biases, which
               limits their applicability. To overcome this computational
               deficit, we undertook a statistical assessment of 200 real-world
               and simulated networks to decipher associations between
               centrality measures and developed an algorithm termed Integrated
               Value of Influence (IVI), which integrates the most important
               and commonly used network centrality measures in an unbiased
               way. When compared against 12 other contemporary influential
               node identification methods on ten different networks, the IVI
               algorithm outperformed all other assessed methods. Using this
               versatile method, network researchers can now identify the most
               influential network nodes.",
