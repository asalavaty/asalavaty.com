  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) refer to a group of
               non-protein-coding RNAs that are usually more than 200
               nucleotides. These long transcripts play significant roles in
               diverse cellular processes, mostly through epigenetic
               mechanisms. Thus, dysregulation of lncRNAs is associated with
               various diseases, especially cancer. This study aims to
               investigate the probable roles of RAB6C-AS1 lncRNA in different
               cancers. METHODS: Real-time quantitative reverse
               transcription-polymerase chain reaction was applied for the
               analysis of RAB6C-AS1 lncRNA amplification in gastric cancer
               (GC) samples compared with normal ones. Also, several online and
               offline data sets and tools were used to analyze the relation
               between RAB6C-AS1 lncRNA and different cancers. RESULTS: The end
               result of our analyses indicated that RAB6C-AS1 was
               overexpressed in 40\% of the investigated GC specimens. Also,
               the results demonstrated a true relation between RAB6C-AS1
               overexpression and higher GC tumor grades. However,
               bioinformatic analyses showed that while RAB6C-AS1 possibly
               functions as an oncogene in some cancer types, including
               prostate and breast cancers, it might have a tumor suppressive
               function in some others including brain tumors. CONCLUSIONS: We
               found that RAB6C-AS1 lncRNA is mostly overexpressed in GC. Also,
               based on bioinformatic and systems biology analyses, RAB6C-AS1
               might function either as an oncogenic factor or tumor suppressor
               in a tissue-specific manner. Thus, RAB6C-AS1 could be considered
               as a candidate biomarker for various malignancies, especially
               prostate and brain cancers. According to our results, RAB6C-AS1
               has a notable prognostic value for patients with brain lower
               grade glioma.",
