abstract: Background Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) refer to a group of non-protein-coding RNAs that are usually more than 200 nucleotides. These long transcripts play significant roles in diverse cellular processes, mostly through epigenetic mechanisms. Thus, dysregulation of lncRNAs is associated with various diseases, especially cancer. This study aims to investigate the probable roles of RAB6C-AS1 lncRNA in different cancers. Methods Real-time quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction was applied for the analysis of RAB6C-AS1 lncRNA amplification in gastric cancer (GC) samples compared with normal ones. Also, several online and offline data sets and tools were used to analyze the relation between RAB6C-AS1 lncRNA and different cancers. Results The end result of our analyses indicated that RAB6C-AS1 was overexpressed in 40% of the investigated GC specimens. Also, the results demonstrated a true relation between RAB6C-AS1 overexpression and higher GC tumor grades. However, bioinformatic analyses showed that while RAB6C-AS1 possibly functions as an oncogene in some cancer types, including prostate and breast cancers, it might have a tumor suppressive function in some others including brain tumors. Conclusions We found that RAB6C-AS1 lncRNA is mostly overexpressed in GC. Also, based on bioinformatic and systems biology analyses, RAB6C-AS1 might function either as an oncogenic factor or tumor suppressor in a tissue-specific manner. Thus, RAB6C-AS1 could be considered as a candidate biomarker for various malignancies, especially prostate and brain cancers. According to our results, RAB6C-AS1 has a notable prognostic value for patients with brain lower grade glioma.

<b>Background</b>: Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) refer to a group of non-protein-coding RNAs that are usually more than 200 nucleotides. These long transcripts play significant roles in diverse cellular processes, mostly through epigenetic mechanisms. Thus, dysregulation of lncRNAs is associated with various diseases, especially cancer. This study aims to investigate the probable roles of RAB6C-AS1 lncRNA in different cancers.  

<b>Methods</b>: Real-time quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction was applied for the analysis of RAB6C-AS1 lncRNA amplification in gastric cancer (GC) samples compared with normal ones. Also, several online and offline data sets and tools were used to analyze the relation between RAB6C-AS1 lncRNA and different cancers.  

<b>Results</b>: The end result of our analyses indicated that RAB6C-AS1 was overexpressed in 40% of the investigated GC specimens. Also, the results demonstrated a true relation between RAB6C-AS1 overexpression and higher GC tumor grades. However, bioinformatic analyses showed that while RAB6C-AS1 possibly functions as an oncogene in some cancer types, including prostate and breast cancers, it might have a tumor suppressive function in some others including brain tumors.
