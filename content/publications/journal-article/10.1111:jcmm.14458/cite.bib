  abstract  = "Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are a subclass of non-protein
               coding transcripts that are involved in several regulatory
               processes and are considered as potential biomarkers for almost
               all cancer types. This study aims to investigate the prognostic
               value of lncRNAs for lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), the most
               prevalent subtype of lung cancer. To this end, the processed
               data of The Cancer Genome Atlas LUAD were retrieved from GEPIA
               and circlncRNAnet databases, matched with each other and
               integrated with the analysis results of a non-small cell lung
               cancer plasma RNA-Seq study. Then, the data were filtered in
               order to separate the differentially expressed lncRNAs that have
               a prognostic value for LUAD. Finally, the selected lncRNAs were
               functionally annotated using a bioinformatic and systems biology
               approach. Accordingly, we identified 19 lncRNAs as the novel
               LUAD prognostic lncRNAs. Also, based on our results, all 19
               lncRNAs might be involved in lung cancer-related biological
               processes. Overall, we suggested several novel biomarkers and
               drug targets which could help early diagnosis, prognosis and
               treatment of LUAD patients.",
