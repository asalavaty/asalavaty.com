  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: The second leading cause of cancer deaths in women
               is breast cancer. Germline mutations in susceptibility breast
               cancer gene BRCA1 increase the lifetime risk of breast cancer.
               Eighty-one large genomic rearrangements (LGRs) have been
               reported up to date in BRCA1 gene, and evaluation of these
               rearrangements helps with precise risk assessment in high-risk
               individuals. In this study, we have investigated LGRs in BRCA1
               among Iranian high-risk breast cancer families. MATERIALS AND
               METHODS: Seventy patients with breast cancer who were identified
               negative for point mutations or small deletions/insertions of
               BRCA1 gene were selected. Deletions and duplications of BRCA1
               gene were evaluated using multiplex ligation-dependent probe
               amplification (MLPA). RESULTS: Two deletions, deletion of exons
               1A/1B-2 and exon 24, were detected in two patients with breast
               cancer. The former alteration was found in a woman with a strong
               family history of breast cancer while the latter one was
               detected in a woman with early onset of breast cancer.
               CONCLUSION: Although our data confirm that LGRs in BRCA1
               comprise a relatively small proportion of mutations in
               hereditary breast cancer in the Iranian population, MLPA
               analysis might be considered for screening of LGRs in high-risk
               individuals. It is worth to note that our results are consistent
               with previous studies in various Asian and European countries.",
