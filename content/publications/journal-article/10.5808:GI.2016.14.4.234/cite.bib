  abstract  = "Different mechanisms, including transcriptional and post
               transcriptional processes, regulate tissue specific expression
               of genes. In this study, we report differences in gene/protein
               compositional features between apoptosis involved genes
               selectively expressed in human tissues. We found some
               correlations between codon/amino acid usage and tissue specific
               expression level of genes. The findings can be significant for
               understanding the translational selection on these features. The
               selection may play an important role in the differentiation of
               human tissues and can be considered for future studies in
               diagnosis of some diseases such as cancer.",
