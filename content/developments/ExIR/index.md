## Overview

<div style="text-align: justify">
High-throughput sequencing technologies have transformed our ability to interrogate biological systems, switching from single gene studies towards generating data on thousands of genes simultaneously. While the latter allows a systematic understanding of the genetic networks driving specific biological functions, functional biological validation of these predicted networks remains a necessity. However, prioritization of candidate genes for functional validation remains a difficult exercise, due to the lack of effective computational tools that can accurately and effectively prioritize the essential genes within a network. We developed ExIR—Experimental data-based Integrative Ranking—which enables the extraction, classification and prioritization of candidates from high-throughput experimental data. ExIR is a standalone computational model able to simultaneously classify genes into “drivers”, “biomarkers”, and “mediators” according to their functional importance. You can also visualize the ExIR results using its {{< staticref "developments/exir-visualization/" "newtab" >}}visualization function{{< /staticref >}}.
