## Overview

<div style="text-align: justify">
ExIR Shiny App is a user-friendly web app for running the {{< staticref "developments/exir/" "newtab" >}}ExIR{{< /staticref >}} model on high-throughput data. This shiny web app provides a graphical user interface to adjust that enables users to adjust all of the parameters and arguments of the ExIR model before running it on their data. Also, users can easily visualize the results and adjust it as they desire. This app also provides a section for {{< staticref "developments/computational-cell-manipulation/" "newtab" >}}Computational Cell Modification{{< /staticref >}} based on any set of ExIR-derived Drivers and/or Mediators.
