## Overview

<div style="text-align: justify">
IVI Shiny App is a user-friendly web app for calculating the influence of network nodes using the {{< staticref "developments/ivi/" "newtab" >}}IVI algorithm{{< /staticref >}}. This shiny web app provides a graphical user interface that enables users to adjust all of the parameters and arguments of the IVI algorithm before running it on their similarity/dissimilarity (e.g. gene co-expression) data. Also, users can easily visualize the network based on the IVI values of nodes and adjust it as they desire.
