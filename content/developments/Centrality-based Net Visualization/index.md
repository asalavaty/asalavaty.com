## Overview

<div style="text-align: justify">
This function has been developed for the visualization of a network based on centrality of nodes (e.g. their {{< staticref "developments/ivi/" "newtab" >}}IVI{{< /staticref >}} values). This function is available in both {{< staticref "developments/influential-r-package/" "newtab" >}}R{{< /staticref >}} and {{< staticref "developments/influential-python-package/" "newtab" >}}Python{{< /staticref >}} versions of the influential package. All of the arguments provided for the adjustment of the visual features of the figure are explained in the function descriptions. Also, the tutorial video showcases the function performance in the R environment.
