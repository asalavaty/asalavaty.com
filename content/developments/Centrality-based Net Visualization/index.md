## Overview

<div style="text-align: justify">
This function has been developed for the visualization of a network based on centrality of nodes (e.g. their {{< staticref "developments/ivi/" "newtab" >}}IVI{{< /staticref >}} values). All of the arguments provided for the adjustment of the visual features of the figure are explained in the tutorial video and in the function description.
