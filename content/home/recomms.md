  content = "**Professor and Group Leader at Monash University**\n\n Adrian is simply an exceptional PhD student, certainly in top few of intellectually gifted and talented students I have ever had in my group. He has single-handedly transformed my groups approach to computational systems biology, written new algorithms and invented completely new systems approaches which he has published or are about to publish. He collaborates with all the senior post dos in my group and has transformed the way we integrate and analyse the transcriptomics and system proteomics data that are the bedrock of the labs approach moving forward. Adrian is a relentless data producing machine who does what he says he will on time and accurately."

Abbas has a special personality and does his responsibilities at the highest possible quality. During the period I was supervising him, I totally wondered how quick he conducts the research and analyses. He is one of the most enterprising students I’ve ever taught or supervised. He has also an insightful, quick, and sharp mind and is really talented in bioinformatics and systems biology. I do admire his unending enthusiasm for learning new skills. Moreover, He is so skillful and experienced in scientific manuscript writing, as he wrote the first draft of the manuscripts derived from his masters’ dissertation. I am certain that he is going to continue to do valuable and creative things in his future."

He has good knowledge in Molecular Genetics and Bioinformatics. He was among the best students in different courses such as Oncology and Genetics. Abbas has also always taken his role seriously in the research team. He’s at his best in a group environment, and is consciously proactive at getting full involvement of all other team members to derive the best results possible. In my unbiased opinion, he has a rich blend of creativity, temperament, and discipline required for research."

I have known Abbas since 2011 when he attended the Shahid Chamran University of Ahvaz as a B.Sc. student in Genetics. Abbas is one of the most outstanding students I have ever taught at the SCU of Ahvaz. His questioning and scientific minds are exceptional. It is so wonderful to me how he could work on 6 high-quality scientific papers during the last two years of his Bachelors and the first year of his Masters. His energetic personality in scientific issues is admirable."
